# at-calculator
A points calculator for the EVE Online Alliance Tournament.  All points and ships are now set for AT XV, current as of Apr 8th, 2017, presuming that Serpentis ships will get a discount in 2017.

To install, simply upload to any server and you are done!  It just uses javascript and HTML, nothing fancy!

Any questions or suggestions, please contact GREYGAL in game.  Isk donations welcomed :)
